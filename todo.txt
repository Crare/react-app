x = done


x  Use Create React App to scaffold your application
    Generate 20 participants that contain randomized values for the following properties: id, name, email address, and phone number
    Render a table that displays the participants on individual rows
    Create a form for adding new participants to the table (remember to validate the form)
    Make each participant editable by clicking on a table cell (inline editing)
    Add support for deleting rows
    Make each column sortable upon clicking on a column header
    Write a developer-friendly installation guide on how to run the app
    Push your code to a public GitHub repository
    Deploy a live build on the internet
    FOLLOW THE DESIGN AS ACCURATELY AS YOU CAN (as for the logo, feel free to render a blank square)
